## Overview
The aim of this page is to contain code repositories that were used in the development of the Individual Placement and Support Cost-Benefit and Outcomes Model (IPS-COM). 

Funded by NIHR grant no 202996 the purpose of the model is to :

- Evaluate the health and economic effects of Individual Placement and Support
- Provide a user-friendly tool which enables users to specify different cost and performance options to evaluate cost-effectiveness of locally implemented programmes

## Code
The modelling was developed in R and R studio, with particular attention to utilising new developments in the software environment to organise, document, and version control code.   

A set of internal R packages have been developed that contain code used for particular purposes, e.g. to clean cross-sectional survey data.
